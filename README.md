#The Odin Project - Recipes

This project is created as part of The Odin project

Project: Recipes is all about using the previously aquired HTML and
CSS knowledge and taking the time to put it to use. The focus during 
the first itteration is to build the HTML framework from scratch. 
Using this practice to get the basics of Web Development right before
continuing on to the next parts of The Odin Project.
